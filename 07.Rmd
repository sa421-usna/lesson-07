# Putting it all together

- In Lesson 1, we discussed the typical steps in a simulation study:

- Now that we've learned the basics of these steps, it's time to put everything together

- A complete report of a simulation study should contain the following sections, in this order:

    1. __Problem Statement.__ See below.
    
    2. __Input Data Analysis.__ See Lesson 6.
    
    3. __Model and Experimental Setup.__ See below.
    
    4. __Output Data Analysis.__ See Lesson 5. 
    
    5. __Conclusion.__ See below. 
    

## Writing the problem statement 

- The problem statement should include the following: 

    - What is the system you are studying? How does the system currently operate?

    - What are the goals that your client wants to accomplish?
    
    - What is the purpose of your study? In particular:
        - What alternatives did you investigate? 
        - What performance measures did you compute?
        - How do these alternatives and performance measures help the client with their objective?


## Describing your model and experiments

- Your description of your simulation model and experimental setup should include:

    - A flow chart of how your system operates, according to your simulation model
    
    - Assumptions about how your system operates
        - For example, what aspects of the system have been excluded from your simulation model?
    
    - The alternatives tested (e.g. number of baristas)
    
    - Number of replications run for each alternative


## Writing the conclusion

- Your conclusion should include:

    - A summary of the most important points from your output data analysis

    - Important limitations of your simulation study
  
    - Guidance for action based on your output data analysis, with a clear caveat that your conclusions are based on the assumptions and limitations of your simulation study and the scope of the questions asked by the decision maker 
    
        - For example, suppose that NCB asked whether to have a coffee dispenser line based on the waiting time of the customers. A reasonable conclusion could be the following:
  
            > Based on our simulation results, we suggest that NCB have a coffee dispenser line as the simulated average waiting time decreased at the barista and cashier queues. However, further analysis would be required to determine the impact of the coffee dispenser line on a customer's overall time in system.


# Making your report presentable

## Hide your code and raw output 

- Rule of thumb: your report should __not__ include any code or raw output

    - Exception: you're writing a report about how to write code

- Up to this point, we've been pretty lax about including code and other detritus in our reports

- It turns out it's pretty easy to hide this stuff - consider the following chunk:

```{r}
print("Hello world")

## to get rid of the [1], you can use the function cat, e.g.,

cat("Hello world", "\n")
```

- To hide the __code__ from your report, change `{r}` in the first line of the chunk to `{r echo=FALSE}`

- To hide the __output__ from your report, change `{r}` in the first line of the chunk to `{r include=FALSE}`

- You can do both simultaneously with `{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}`

## Organize your report into sections

- Organize your report into sections. You can start a new section or subsection in R Markdown by starting a new line with some number of `#`s, like this:

# A section

## A subsection

### A subsubsection

#### A subsubsubsection


# What's next?

- More __simulation modeling concepts__ in JaamSim, for example:

    - balking and reneging
    
    - queueing discipline
    
    - using multiple resources simultaneously
    
    - inventory levels

- __Projects.__ You will conduct complete simulation studies of systems that require these modeling concepts, and write reports about your process and findings. 

- An interlude on __simulation theory__

    - How are random numbers generated? How do we sample from a particular distribution? 
    
    - How can we improve the predictions that result from our simulation experiments?
